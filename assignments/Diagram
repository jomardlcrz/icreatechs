# Create a diagram of a computer system showing how the main components connect and interact with each other.

Key Connections & Interactions:
1. CPU (Central Processing Unit):
   - Connected directly to the Northbridge (or directly to RAM in modern systems with integrated memory controllers).
   - Executes instructions and processes data.

2. Northbridge (Memory Controller Hub):
   - Connects the CPU to high-speed components like RAM and GPU (though modern GPUs often connect via PCIe directly to the CPU).
   - Manages communication between CPU, RAM, and Southbridge.

3. Southbridge (I/O Controller Hub):
   - Connects to the Northbridge and manages slower peripherals (USB, SATA, Ethernet, etc.).
   - Connects to storage devices (HDD/SSD) and expansion slots (PCIe, PCI).

4. RAM (Random Access Memory):
   - Directly accessed by the CPU (via Northbridge) for fast data storage/retrieval.

5. Peripherals:
   - Input devices (keyboard, mouse) and output devices (monitor, printer) connect via Southbridge (or directly via USB/PCIe).

6. Storage Devices:
   - HDDs/SSDs connect via SATA or NVMe (directly to CPU or Southbridge).
